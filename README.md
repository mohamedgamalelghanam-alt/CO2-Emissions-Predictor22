# CO2-Emissions-Predictor22
This project is a deep learning model to predict vehicle CO2 emissions based on various car features like engine size, fuel consumption, and transmission type. The model is trained on the Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions dataset and deployed using Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and joblib
